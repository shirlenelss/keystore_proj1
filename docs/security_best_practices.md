# Security Best Practices Guide

This document outlines security best practices implemented in the Keystore Manager project and recommendations for real-world usage.

## Key Management Best Practices

### 1. Key Generation
- **Minimum Key Size**: Use at least 2048-bit RSA keys
- **Recommended Key Size**: 4096-bit RSA for high-security applications
- **Key Sources**: Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- **Key Algorithms**: Prefer modern algorithms (RSA-OAEP, ECDSA P-256/P-384)

### 2. Key Storage
- **File Permissions**: Private keys should be 0600 (read/write by owner only)
- **Password Protection**: Always encrypt private keys with strong passwords
- **Secure Deletion**: Overwrite key material multiple times before deletion
- **Hardware Security**: Use HSMs for production environments

### 3. Key Rotation
- **Regular Rotation**: Rotate keys annually or based on usage volume
- **Compromise Response**: Immediate rotation if key compromise is suspected
- **Gradual Migration**: Support both old and new keys during transition

## Certificate Management

### 1. Certificate Validation
- **Chain Verification**: Always validate the entire certificate chain
- **Expiration Monitoring**: Monitor certificates for upcoming expiration
- **Revocation Checking**: Implement CRL/OCSP checking in production
- **Hostname Verification**: Validate certificate subject matches usage

### 2. Certificate Authority
- **Root CA Protection**: Keep root CA offline and highly secured
- **Intermediate CAs**: Use intermediate CAs for operational signing
- **Certificate Policies**: Define and enforce certificate usage policies
- **Audit Logging**: Log all certificate operations

### 3. Certificate Lifecycle
- **Issuance Controls**: Implement proper authorization for certificate requests
- **Renewal Automation**: Automate certificate renewal where possible
- **Revocation Management**: Have processes for certificate revocation
- **Archive Management**: Securely archive expired certificates

## Password Security

### 1. Password Policies
- **Minimum Length**: At least 12 characters
- **Complexity**: Require mixed case, numbers, and special characters
- **Forbidden Patterns**: Block common passwords and patterns
- **Regular Updates**: Enforce periodic password changes for sensitive accounts

### 2. Password Storage
- **Hashing Algorithm**: Use PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2
- **Salt Usage**: Use unique salts for each password
- **Iteration Count**: Use sufficient iterations (100,000+ for PBKDF2)
- **Secure Comparison**: Use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks

## Security Operations

### 1. Monitoring and Logging
- **Audit Trails**: Log all security-relevant operations
- **Log Protection**: Protect log files from tampering
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement real-time security monitoring
- **Incident Response**: Have procedures for security incidents

### 2. Vulnerability Management
- **Regular Scanning**: Perform regular vulnerability scans
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Security Testing**: Include security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing

### 3. Access Control
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Require MFA for sensitive operations
- **Session Management**: Implement proper session handling
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically review and audit access

## Compliance Considerations

### 1. Regulatory Requirements
- **Data Protection**: Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws
- **Industry Standards**: Follow PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX as applicable
- **Government Standards**: FIPS 140-2, Common Criteria compliance

### 2. Documentation
- **Security Policies**: Maintain up-to-date security policies
- **Procedure Documentation**: Document all security procedures
- **Incident Documentation**: Keep records of security incidents
- **Training Records**: Document security awareness training

## Common Security Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Hard-coded Secrets**: Never hard-code passwords or keys in source code
2. **Weak Randomness**: Don't use predictable random number generators
3. **Insufficient Logging**: Inadequate security event logging
4. **Poor Key Management**: Storing keys in plain text or with weak protection
5. **Ignoring Updates**: Not keeping security libraries updated
6. **Weak Access Controls**: Overly permissive access controls
7. **No Incident Response**: Lack of security incident response procedures
8. **Compliance Gaps**: Not meeting regulatory security requirements

## Emergency Procedures

### Key Compromise
1. Immediately revoke compromised certificates
2. Generate new key pairs
3. Update all systems using the compromised key
4. Investigate the scope of compromise
5. Document the incident

### Certificate Authority Compromise
1. Revoke all certificates issued by compromised CA
2. Generate new CA certificate
3. Re-issue all certificates
4. Update trust stores across all systems
5. Notify all stakeholders

### Security Incident Response
1. Contain the incident
2. Assess the impact
3. Collect evidence
4. Notify stakeholders
5. Remediate vulnerabilities
6. Document lessons learned
